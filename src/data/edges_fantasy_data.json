It must meet the Requirements as usual.<br /> Death: If the mount perishes, another takes its place eventually, perhaps after a narrative encounter or visit to a place where such creatures can be tamed or purchased.<br /> - GREAT MOUNT: At Heroic Rank you may choose to keep your mount and Advance it normally, or dismiss it for a “Great Mount.” (Or simply take a Great Mount if you didn't have this Edge previously.)<br /> Normal Size heroes may choose a bear, dinosaur (giant herbivore or pterosaur), elephant, giant animal (bird, centipede, scorpion, toad), griffin, hippogriff, pegasus, sabre-toothed tiger, unicorn, or wyvern.

Smaller heroes have three additional choices: cockatrice, dragon (hatchling), hellhound, or small elemental.<br /> A Legendary Mounts' Smarts is one die type higher than normal, it's a Wild Card, and it gains one Advance for each of its master's Ranks as described above."
